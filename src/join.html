				<h3>Non-Milken Students/Parents</h3>
				<p>Any Milken Community Schools student (grades 6-12, included) can join Team 1836. If you are
					considering Milken as a middle or high school, we encourage you to visit <a
							href="http://www.milkenschool.org/Page/ADMISSION">Milken’s Admissions page</a> to learn more
					about attending Milken. If you tour the school, make sure to mention you are interested in robotics
					so that there is ample time for you to visit our shop. Additionally, if you are interested in
					touring our shop at another time, you can contact us. <br> <br> If you are not in the Los Angeles
					area or Milken is not an option for you, there are many other FIRST® Robotics Competition teams in
					the surrounding areas and around the world. The FIRST® Website has a <a
							href="http://www.firstinspires.org/team-event-search#type=teams&sort=name&programs=FRC">complete
						listing</a>. Younger students can also check out FIRST® LEGO® League Junior (6 to 10 years),
					FIRST® LEGO® League (9-14 years), and FIRST® Tech Challenge (7-12 grade).</p>
				<h3>Current Milken Students</h3>
				<p>All Milken students are welcomed to join the team and encouraged to stop by the shop at get a feel
					for our program. Students do not need any technical knowledge to join the team. We have both
					technical and nontechnical roles available and each student will be trained in whatever it is they
					would like to pursue. Our preseason meetings begin in August and the build season begins in January.
					If you are interested in joining or have additional questions, contact us.

				<p>Mentorship is an essential component of any FIRST® team. Team 1836 is able to utilize the guidance of
					any skilled individual whether it be technical (mechanical engineering, electrical engineering,
