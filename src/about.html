				<h3>Mission</h3>
				<p>It is our mission to challenge youth to create a lasting effect on their community through service
					learning, Science, Technology, Relationships, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics. Leading all of us
					to a brighter future.</p>
				<h3>Team History</h3>
				<p>Team 1836: The MilkenKnights was founded in 2005 by a small group of students who were passionate
					about robotics. We compete at the FIRST Robotics Competition or FRC with team members ages 13-18.
					FRC is an annual international high school robotics competition. Each year, teams of high school
					students compete to build robots weighing up to 120 pounds. At the beginning of January, teams are
					given six weeks to design, construct and program a robot to play in the year's game. We are proud
					finalists of the 2014 Israel Regional Competition and champions of the 2013 Los Angeles Region.
					While the team originally engaged in a fierce debate about what to name the team when it was
					founded, the students finally settled on Milken Knights, a play on the word for students who attend
					Milken Community Schools: “Milkenites”. The name stuck, and from then on the Milken Knights galloped
					into the future with bold red colors and fiery passion. Recently we have decided that as our team
					matures in age we should mature in image as well. We decided to change our team colors to blue and
					black as to graduate from brash young squires to seasoned professional knights. We wished to better
					honor the blue of our school colors from which our name is so lovingly derived. Our team attributes
					its success to it value of its three core principles: Encouraging Creativity, Giving back to the
					Community, and Collaboration.</p>
